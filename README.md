# GLF Example Table

Welcome to the **GLF Example Table**!

This project was created to demonstrate the core features of [GLF](https://github.com/mpcarr/vpx-glf) (Game Logic Framework) within Visual Pinball X (VPX). While it began as a technical showcase, it has also evolved into a fun little game on its own. ðŸŽ‰

---

## Getting Started

To begin using this table and learning GLF, read the [Environment Setup Guide](https://mpcarr.github.io/vpx-glf/environment-setup/).

---

## Caveats & Notes

- **GLF is flexible** â€” there are often multiple ways to do things. This example is just one possible implementation.
- **Not all features are demonstrated** â€” check the [GLF documentation](https://mpcarr.github.io/vpx-glf/) for the full feature set.
- **GLF is under development** â€” bugs or missing features may exist.
- **Balls must not be destroyed** â€” required by GLF.
- **All game logic should go through GLF** â€” ensures portability to real hardware via [MPF](https://missionpinball.org/latest/).
- **PUP Player is not supported** â€” use the included Godot media player instead.
- **No VLM visuals included** â€” but easy to integrate (see the [Dark Chaos](https://github.com/apophis79/darkchaos) project for an example).
